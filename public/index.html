      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <p>Enter a sentence and hit the graph button.  Keep it simple!  This is a baby algorithm
        and can't handle much yet.  I'd like to get it to handle simple cases well before trying
        tough stuff.</p>
      <p>After you see the graph, you'll see the rules used to put the words in their place.
        Check any of the rules that seem wrong, and then click send (once!).
        Feel free to try more sentences after that.
